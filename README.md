# TC comparison

Here I evaluateÂ the present and future tropical cyclone damage using different sources of storm tracks in CLIMADA.

Tropical cyclones (TC) cause devastating damage to infrastructure and are a concerning threat to human life. Records of historic TCs are very limited and therefore the data to study impacts of this natural hazard remain sparse. The generation of synthetic storm tracks is an important tool to overcome this spatial and temporal limitation.

We perform the first global model intercomparisons of different synthetic TC track sets. We use the CLIMADA (CLIMate ADAptation, Aznar-Siguan and Bresch, 2019) platform, which integrates hazard, exposure, and vulnerability data, to compute TC risk and to quantify socio-economic impacts for different storm track sets. Our comparison shows how the selection of a TC track set might affect the estimated damage and which dataset is suitable to answer what type of research question. Specifically, we provide a qualitative overview of the different TC model types, we compare damage by return period and perform a global sensitivity analysis for selected TC damage model parameters.
